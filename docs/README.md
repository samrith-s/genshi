# Genshi docs

The entire documentation of Genshi resides here. It is powered by [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This directory is not part of the workspace. To setup, you can simply install the dependencies in this directory:

```bash
cd docs && yarn install
```

To run the development server, you can run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The docs are hosted on Vercel, and any commit made to the `main` branch will automatically deploy.
