Genshi is written in TypeScript and can be used with any JavaScript framework or library.

If you are using a library that is not officially supported, you can still use Genshi with it. You will have to create your library-specific bindings to work with the library.

## Installation

To use Genshi with other libraries, you need to install the core package using your favorite package manager.

<PackageManagers pkg="@genshi/core" />

## Usage

Genshi provides a `Store` class that you can use to create a store for your application. Everything you need to manage your application state is provided by the `Store` class.

### Creating our store

First, let's create a store with an initial state.

```ts
import { Store } from "@genshi/core";

const store = new Store({
  count: 0,
});
```

The `Store` class creates an instance of the store. It also provides methods to define and dispatch actions and effects.

### Defining actions

The `action` method on the store instance is used to define an action. The action function takes the current state as an argument and returns the new state.

```ts
const increment = store.action("increment", (state) => ({
  ...state,
  count: state.count + 1,
}));
```

The above action increments the count by `1`.

### Defining effects

The `effect` method on the store instance is used to define an effect. The effect function provides many properties to ease managing effects. One such property is the `dispatch` method, which can be used to dispatch other effects or actions.

```ts
const tick = store.effect("tick", ({ dispatch }) => {
  setInterval(() => {
    dispatch(increment);
  }, 1000);
});
```

The above effect dispatches the `increment` action every second.

### Using the store in your application

Now that we have defined our actions and effects, we can use the store in our application.

In this case, we will consider a simple counter application built in React, that uses the `@genshi/core` package directly.

```ts {"Set the initial count value from store":2-3} {"Subscribe to changes to the store":5-12} {"Dispatch the tick effect on component mount":14-17} {"Increment the count on button click":19-22}
function Counter() {

  const [count, setCount] = useState(store.getState().count);


  useEffect(() => {
    const listener = store.subscribe((state) => {
      setCount(state.count);
    });

    return listener.remove;
  }, []);


  useEffect(() => {
    store.dispatch(tick);
  }, []);


  const handleIncrement = () => {
    store.dispatch(increment);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <p>The count is: {count}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```
