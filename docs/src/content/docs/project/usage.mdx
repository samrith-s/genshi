Genshi comes as a self-serving package that you can install in your project using your favorite package manager.

<Steps>

1. Add Genshi to your project.

   <Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
     <TabItem label="npm">
       <Code code="npm install @genshi/core" lang="bash" frame="code" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="yarn">
       <Code code="yarn add @genshi/core" lang="bash" frame="code" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">
       <Code code="pnpm install @genshi/core" lang="bash" frame="code" />
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Import Genshi in your project.

   <Code
     code="import { Store } from '@genshi/core';"
     lang="javascript"
     frame="code"
   />

</Steps>

## Usage

Genshi is built to be used alongside a view library (like React, Vue, or Svelte).

:::note
Currently, Genshi only has integration with React. You can use Genshi with any other view library, but you will need to write custom bindings to make it work.
:::

<CardGrid>
  <IntegrationCard
    name="React"
    icon="react"
    href="/integrations/react"
    description="Use Genshi with a React application"
  />
  <IntegrationCard
    custom
    name="Other libraries"
    href="#"
    description="Integrate Genshi with any view library"
  />
</CardGrid>
