import Reference from "~/components/reference.astro";

Genshi's API is designed to be minimal and flexible. The core package provides a lot of features, but the primary focus for consumers is expected to be limited to the `Store` class. This document only covers the APIs of that class.

To create a new store, you can use the `Store` class directly:

```ts title="Example"
import { Store } from "@genshi/core";

const store = new Store({
  count: 0,
});
```

The `Store` constructor also provides an optional second argument for configuration the name of the store. This is particularly useful for debugging purposes.

```ts title="Example"
const store = new Store(0, "CounterStore");
```

## Properties

#### id

<Reference type="string" readonly />

- Unique identifier for the store
- Generated when the store is created

### name

<Reference type="string" readonly />

- Name of the store
- Only assignable during store creation

### tag

<Reference type="string" readonly />

- The tag is a special identifier that is used to identify the store while debugging
- The tag is assigned automatically during store creation
- If a `name` is provided, the tag will be the name otherwise it will be the `id`

## Methods

### action

- The `action` method is used to create a new action
- Action functions are pure functions that take the current state and return a new state

:::

```ts title="Example"
const increment = store.action("increment", (state, payload) => {
  return {
    count: state.count + payload,
  };
});
```

### effect

- The `effect` method is used to create a new effect
- Effect functions are impure functions that can perform side effects

:::

```ts title="Example"
const log = store.effect("log", (state) => {
  console.log(state);
});
```

### dispatch

- The `dispatch` method is used to dispatch an action or effect
- The method takes the action or effect function as the first argument and an optional payload as the second argument

```ts title="Example"
store.dispatch(increment, 10);
```

### subscribe

- The `subscribe` method is used to listen to changes in the store
- It does not provide a way to subscribe to specific events, but only has one callback that is called whenever the store changes
- Returns a listener with a `remove` method to unsubscribe

```ts title="Example"
const listener = store.subscribe((state) => {
  console.log("Store changed:", state.count);
});
listener.remove();
```

### getState

- Get the current state of the store
- The state is a snapshot of the store's data at the time of the call and is changing it will not affect the store

```ts title="Example"
const state = store.getState();
```

### getPreviousStates

- Get a list of previous states
- The list is ordered from latest to oldest
- The states returned are all sealed to prevent mutation

```ts title="Example"
const previousStates = store.getPreviousStates();
```

### history

- Returns the history of all the actions and effects that have been performed by the store
- The list is ordered from latest to oldest

```ts title="Example"
const history = store.history();
```

### printHistory

- Prints the history to the console in a table
- Useful for debugging and understanding the sequence of actions and effects

```ts title="Example"
store.printHistory();
```
