The React package provides the `createStore` utility function to create a new store and a hook to access the store's state.

To understand how to create actions and effects, refer to the API documentation of the [core package](/docs/reference/package-core). Head over to the [React guide](/docs/guides/react) to learn how to use Genshi with React.

```ts title="Example"
import { createStore } from "@genshi/react";

export const [store, useStore] = createStore({
  count: 0,
});
```

The `createStore` method also provides an optional second argument for configuration the name of the store. This is particularly useful for debugging purposes.

```ts title="Example"
const [store, useStore] = createStore(0, "CounterStore");
```

### `createStore`

- The `createStore` function is used to create a new store
- It accepts an object with the initial state and returns a tuple with the store and a hook to access the store's state

### `useStore`

- The `useStore` hook is used to access the store's state
- The hook accepts a selector function which can select a specific property or the entire state itself
- The hook will re-render the component whenever the selected state changes
- You can use multiple `useStore` hooks in a single component which can select different parts of the state
- Since it is a tuple, you can name the hook anything you want

### `store`

- The `store` object is the instance of the store
- For the complete API of the store, refer to the [core package](/docs/reference/package-core)
- Since it is a tuple, you can name the store anything you want
